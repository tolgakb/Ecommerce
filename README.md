# Ecommerce

In this project, a shopping website has been built.

On the homepage, a link is given to the user to create a new account and all stored products are listed with their detailed information, for example, with their name, photo and price. Users can access the detail page of the product by clicking on the product whenever they want.

On the detail page of the product, more details are given about the product, for example, the photo of the product, its name, the brand of the product, the description of the product, the price of the product and the user can specify the number of products they want to buy and add the product to their cart.

Users have features such as adding products to the cart, changing the number of items in the cart after adding the product, and deleting the product from the cart. The price information of the product is determined for that product by multiplying the price of the product with the number of products. The total price information of the products in the cart is also given to the user. The total number of items in the cart is shown to the user on the cart icon in the navigation bar and the user can access his cart by clicking this icon.

During registration, which is one of the authentication processes, a form is presented to the user. In this form, the user wants to create his/her membership by filling in the username, email address, password and password verification fields. At this stage, the user's e-mail address is checked, and if the e-mail address is already registered, the user is informed that this e-mail address cannot be used to create a membership. If not, an account verification e-mail is sent to the user's e-mail address, and the user can activate their account by clicking the link in the e-mail.

Users can log in to their accounts by entering their username and password information. Users are directed to the dashboard page after logging in. In this section, users can access previous order information, they can perform actions related to their accounts, such as changing their username or changing their email address and they can delete their account if they wish.

Users can change the password of their account whenever they wish. This situation starts by sending a password renewal e-mail to the e-mail address, just like in the case of logging in for the first time, and users can set their new password via this e-mail.

When users complete their shopping and click proceed the checkout, they must first fill in the address information for their orders to be shipped. If the user is not registered yet, or a user who is logged in and has not filled in their address information yet, this form will be blank. However, if the user has already filled in shipping information, this form will appear prefilled.

In order for the user to complete his order, he must first fill in the address information section. If he has not filled out the form, the buttons to complete his order with paypal and other bank cards are not clickable if their address information is filled in, they can complete their orders with paypal or other bank cards.
